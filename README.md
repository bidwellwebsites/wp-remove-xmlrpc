# wp-remove-xmlrpc

This is a simple zero-config WordPress plugin that disables XMLRPC and removes the related tags from head. This functionality isn't needed for most sites, and only gives attackers another possible way into your site. We use this plugin at [Bidwell Websites](https://bidwellwebsites.com/) to improve the security of the sites we build.
